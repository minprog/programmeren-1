# Hello

> Deze opdracht is niet individueel, maar ook niet bedoeld voor samenwerken. Het doel is ervaring opdoen met belangrijke technieken en de bedoeling is dat je dit zelf doet. Maar schroom niet hulp te vragen, en als het nodig is kan iemand het even voordoen voor je. Als je naderhand ook zelfstandig alle stappen doorlopen hebt.

## Hello, World

Meet your first C program:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }

## Dive into the IDE

Hello, world! Hopefully you have succeeded in creating a CS50 IDE instance for yourself. You should have watched Doug's video on its use before continuing here. Let's make programs!

Go to the Terminal and issue the following command:

    mkdir ~/module0

You should see in the file list on the left that your first folder has been created. We call it `module0` so it can contain all programs that you write for the current module.

Now, point to the File menu and choose New. This will open a new editor with a blank "Untitled1" file in it. First thing to do is to give it a name and save it into your new directory. Press **CTRL-S** or **Cmd-S** to open the file dialog. For **Filename**, type `hello.c`. Then below, choose (click) the `module1` folder that you just created and click on **Save**.

In your new file, type the C code for "Hello, World" as seen above. Save it once more.

Let's point the terminal towards our new folder:

    cd ~/module0

The **prompt** is what the Terminal shows on your screen to "prompt" you to enter a new command. The prompt includes a portion to show what folder the Terminal is pointed towards. It should look like this, indicating that the **current folder** for the Terminal is indeed `~/module0`.

    ~/module0/ $

Next, type precisely the below (in lowercase), then hit Enter:

    ls

You should see just `hello.c`. That's because you've just listed the files in that same folder, this time using a command-line interface (CLI), using just your keyboard, rather than the graphical user interface (GUI) represented by that folder icon. In particular, you *executed* (i.e., ran) a command called `ls`, which is shorthand for "list." (It's such a frequently used command that its authors called it just `ls` to save keystrokes.) Make sense?

Here on out, to execute (i.e., run) a command means to type it into a terminal window and then hit Enter. Commands are "case-sensitive," so be sure not to type in uppercase when you mean lowercase or vice versa.

## Compiling Programs

Now, before we can execute the program at right, recall that we must *compile* it with a *compiler* (e.g., `clang`), translating it from *source code* into *machine code* (i.e., zeroes and ones). Execute the command below to do just that:

    clang hello.c

And then execute this one again:

    ls

This time, you should see not only `hello.c` but `a.out` listed as well? (You can see the same graphically if you click that folder icon again.) That's because `clang` has translated the source code in `hello.c` into machine code in `a.out`, which happens to stand for "assembler output," but more on that another time.

Now run the program by executing the below.

    ./a.out

Hello, world, indeed!

## Naming Programs

Now, `a.out` isn't the most user-friendly name for a program. Let's compile `hello.c` again, this time saving the machine code in a file called, more aptly, `hello`. Execute the below.

    clang -o hello hello.c

Take care not to overlook any of those spaces therein! Then execute this one again:

    ls

You should now see not only `hello.c` (and `a.out` from before) but also `hello` listed as well? That's because `-o` is a *command-line argument*, sometimes known as a *flag* or a *switch*, that tells `clang` to output (hence the `o`) a file called `hello`. Execute the below to try out the newly named program.

    ./hello

Hello there again!

## Making Things Easier

Recall that we can automate the process of executing `clang`, letting `make` figure out how to do so for us, thereby saving us some keystrokes. Execute the below to compile this program one last time.

    make hello

You should see that `make` executes `clang` with even more command-line arguments for you? More on those, too, another time!

Now execute the program itself one last time by executing the below.

    ./hello

Phew!

## Getting User Input

Suffice it to say, no matter how you compile or execute this program, it only ever prints `hello, world`. Let's personalize it a bit, just as we did in class.

Modify this program in such a way that it first prompts the user for their name and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their actual name.

As before, be sure to compile your program with:

    make hello

And be sure to execute your program, testing it a few times with different inputs, with:

    ./hello

### Staff's Solution

To try out the staff's implementation of this problem, execute

    ./hello

within [this sandbox](http://bit.ly/2Qp0a2g). You can do that to be 100% sure that you understand
what is required of your own program.

### Hints

#### Don't recall how to prompt the user for their name?

Recall that you can use `get_string` as follows, storing its *return value* in a variable called `name` of type `string`.

    string name = get_string("What is your name?\n");

#### Don't recall how to format a string?

Don't recall how to join (i.e., concatenate) the user's name with a greeting? Recall that you can use `printf` not only to print but to format a string (hence, the `f` in `printf`), a la the below, wherein `name` is a `string`.

    printf("hello, %s\n", name);

#### Use of undeclared identifier?

Seeing the below, perhaps atop other errors?

    error: use of undeclared identifier 'string'; did you mean 'stdin'?

Recall that, to use `get_string`, you need to include `cs50.h` (in which `get_string` is *declared*) atop a file, as with:

    #include <cs50.h>

## Testing

To verify whether your program is indeed running well, you may use `check50` in the Terminal. Make sure that your Terminal is still pointing towards the directory that your `hello.c` resides in!

    check50 -l minprog/cs50x/2020/hello

## How to submit

As soon as you're done, submit your `hello.c` implementation, below! 

1. Toward CS50 IDE's top-left corner, within its "file browser" (not within a terminal window), control-click or right-click your `hello.c` file (that's within your `module0` directory) and then select **Download**. You should find that your browser has downloaded `hello.c`.

2. Make sure you are signed in to **this** website!

3. In the form below, choose the file that you just downloaded.

4. Press "Submit for grading". Presto!

Your program will then again be checked using `check50` and the result will be recorded on this website. If the check fails, be sure to try if `check50` is still satisfied when you run it in your IDE's Terminal!
