## Itching to program?

It's time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

- Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
- Your project must use at least one sound.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Ivy's Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129587/). As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Head to [the Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and sign up for an account on MIT's website by clicking **Join Scratch** atop the page. Any username (that's available) is fine, but take care to remember it and your choice of password. After registering and confirming your email address, click the orange "**Start Creating**" button to begin.

## Ideas

To get started, try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. If you're stuck for ideas and you'd like to try out some Scratch projects from past students, here are a few:

- [It's Raining Men](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37412/), from lecture
- [Ivy's Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129587/), a game, Harvard edition
- [Soccer](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37413/), a game
- [Cookie Love Story](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329196/), an animation
- [Gingerbread tales](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277536784/), an interactive story
- [Intersection](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/75390754/), a game
- [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196/), a game

## Getting unstuck

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won't find it too hard to satisfy the above requirements.

One strategy to try is taking baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth. It should help you find your focus. Oh, and select **File > Save Now** every few minutes so that you don't lose any work!

> If getting unstuck by yourself doesn't quite work out, feel free to ask the staff for help! When you ask for help, it doesn't have to be about a specific technical problem. Getting lost in what you want to make is something that happens to the best of us! So it's fine to say "I need help getting unstuck." Try it.

Alright, off you go. Make us proud!

## How to submit

Once finished with your project:

- Select **File > Save to your computer** at the top of the scratch website. This should download a file whose name ends in `.sb3`.

- Click the orange **Share** button at the top of Scratch's editor, which will redirect you to the "Project page". On that page, ensure your project has a title, some instructions, and some notes and/or credits. Finally, take note of the URL in your browser's address bar. That's your project's URL on MIT's website.

- On the tab "Submit", you should find a form where you can attach your `.sb3` file and paste your project's URL. If there is no form, you might have forgotten to logon to this website and register your name!

If you have any questions or issues with the above steps, reach out to the TAs!
