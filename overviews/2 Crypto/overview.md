# Module 2: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about cryptographic techniques and about strings in C. Strings will prove to be an important part of almost any program, indeed.

## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Attend your mentor's section meeting.

1. Use `help50`, `eprintf` and `debug50` as needed.

1. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

1. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## What to Do

### 1. Preparation

Watch the lecture on [Arrays](/lectures/arrays).

### 2. Problems

Implement solutions to these three problems:

- [Initials](/problems/initials-less)
- [Caesar](/problems/caesar)
- [Vigenere](/problems/vigenere)

### 3. Hacker Problems

Solving and submitting the hacker problems in addition to the standard problems may earn you 1 extra point for this module. However, you must submit all problems before the original deadline to be eligible for this point.

- [Initials](/problems/initials-more), for those more comfortable
- [Crack](/problems/crack), for those more comfortable

### 4. Tests

Study and take the tests:

- [Control Flow](/exercises/control-flow)

- [Loops](/exercises/loops)

### 5. Code review

1. As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems, you should take time to improve on the "quality" of your programs. For this module, we only look at the following four criteria, which you might have seen mentioned in the lectures:

	- [Nesting](/quality/nesting) (NEW!)
    - [Comments](/quality/comments)
    - [Naming](/quality/naming)
    - [Indenting code](/quality/indentation)
    - [Whitespace](/quality/whitespace)

2. Don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much. And feel free to ignore the suggestions if you feel your code's layout is more consistent like it is.

3. Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will review their code on the criteria above, and they will review your code.

4. Then, you should submit the problems again. Your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for quality, and provide you with some written feedback. The feedback will never be "everything" that can be improved, but a small sample. When you receive it, compare it to the ideas that you got during your own code review, and think how you could improve on the review next time.
