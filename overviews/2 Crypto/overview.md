# Module 2: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about cryptographic techniques and about strings in C. Strings will prove to be an important part of almost any program, indeed.

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Magic numbers](/quality-aspects/magic-numbers)
- [Loops](/quality-aspects/loops)
- [Duplication](/quality-aspects/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality-aspects/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from last week:

- [Comments](/quality-aspects/comments)
- [Naming](/quality-aspects/naming)
- [Indenting code](/quality-aspects/indentation)
- [Whitespace](/quality-aspects/whitespace)
