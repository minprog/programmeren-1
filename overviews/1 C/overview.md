# Module 1: C

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You'll start with the small ones!

## Getting Started

Your first program will be a classic. The goal of this exercise is to try out compiling your program, maybe fixing a typo and getting used to the editor. No need to submit!

- Watch the lecture on [C](/lectures/c)

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:.external}

- Write your first program: [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/hello/){:.external}

Next up, you'll create an instance of the CS50 IDE, which will be your "code editor" for the coming weeks. The goal is to write a very small program from scratch and learning to test your program using `check50`. (Note that the IDE currently only works in Chrome and Firefox!)

- Login to the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/){:.external} using your GitHub account

- Learn about using the [Command Line](/shorts/command-line) in the IDE

- Implement [Water](/problems/water)


## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- Use of comments
- Naming of variables
- Use of indentation
- Use of whitespace


## What to Do

#### Greedy

Implement and submit either of:

- [Greedy](/problems/greedy), which we expect most students to solve

- [Credit](/problems/credit), aimed at students who already have quite some experience with programming

#### Mario

- Watch the lecture on [Tools](/lectures/tools)

- Implement and submit either of:

    - [Mario](/problems/mario-less), for most students

    - [Mario](/problems/mario-more), for those more comfortable

#### Thursday exercises

Study and take the test on Thursday:

- [Variables](/exercises/variables)

- [Control Flow](/exercises/control-flow)


## Submitting

You can submit your solutions on the problem pages linked above. Before submitting, keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (like plagiarism).
