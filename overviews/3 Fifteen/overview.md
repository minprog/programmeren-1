# Module 3: Fifteen

In this module, you'll learn about arrays and about algorithms that you might implement in C. Searching and sorting algorithms will be part of many programs that you write!


## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Attend your mentor's section meeting.

1. Use `help50`, `eprintf` and `debug50` as needed.

1. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

1. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Dead code](/quality/dead-code)
- [Duplicated effort](/quality/duplicated-effort)
- [Scope](/quality/scope)

And we'll also take these into account from previous weeks: [comments](/quality/comments), [naming](/quality/naming), [indentation](/quality/indentation), [whitespace](/quality/whitespace), [duplication](/quality/duplication), [nesting](/quality/nesting), [magic numbers](/quality/magic-numbers), and [choosing loops](/quality/loops).

## What to Do

### 1. Preparation

Watch the lecture on [Algorithms](/lectures/algorithms).

### 2. Problems

Implement:

- [Find](/problems/find-less)

- [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen-less)

### 3. Hacker Problems

Implement:

- [Find](/problems/find-more)

- [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen-more)

### 4. Tests

Study and take the test:

- [Arrays](/exercises/arrays)

### 5. Code review

1. As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems, you should take time to improve on the "quality" of your programs. For this module, we only look at the following four criteria, which you might have seen mentioned in the lectures:

	- 
	- [Nesting](/quality/nesting)
    - [Comments](/quality/comments)
    - [Naming](/quality/naming)
    - [Indenting code](/quality/indentation)
    - [Whitespace](/quality/whitespace)

2. Don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much. And feel free to ignore the suggestions if you feel your code's layout is more consistent like it is.

3. Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will review their code on the criteria above, and they will review your code.

4. Then, you should submit the problems again. Your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for quality, and provide you with some written feedback. The feedback will never be "everything" that can be improved, but a small sample. When you receive it, compare it to the ideas that you got during your own code review, and think how you could improve on the review next time.
