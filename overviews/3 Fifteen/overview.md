# Module 3: Fifteen

In this module, you'll learn about arrays and about algorithms that you might implement in C. Searching and sorting algorithms will be part of many programs that you write!


## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Attend your mentor's section meeting.

1. Use `help50`, `eprintf` and `debug50` as needed.

1. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- TBA


## What to Do

- Watch the lecture on [Algorithms](/lectures/algorithms)

- Implement either of:

    - [Find](/problems/find-less), for those less comfortable

    - [Find](/problems/find-more), for those more comfortable

- Implement [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen)

- Study and take the test:

	- [Arrays](/exercises/arrays)

	- [Loops](/exercises/loops)
