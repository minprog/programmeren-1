## Practice exercises

Take your Programming Basics book and do **all exercises** from chapters 8 and 9. It's important to do the exercises by hand (on paper), without using a calculator. When done like that, you'll develop a little bit of intuition about the basic calculations that are part of many computer programs. You will need it for the next module.

If you already have some experience with calculations in programming languages, be sure to do the last few exercises of every page and check if what you think is the answer is indeed correct! All answers are in the back of the book.

After completing your practice exercises you will take an online test. We intend you to make it without errors. When you fail the online test you can simply take it again. If you have any questions, just drop the question in the forums and discuss!
