# Exercises: Variables and Expressions

> Dit is je eerste opdracht om te oefenen met programmeerconcepten. Hiervoor gebruik je het [Basisboek Programmeren](https://www.stgm.nl/basics/). De bedoeling is dat je na het oefenen een online test (bijna) foutloos kunt doen. Zorg dat je je mentor in de loop van de weken laat zien dat je de verschillende oefeningen gedaan hebt. Bewaar daarom je aantekeningen en uitwerkingen.


## Data Types

Watch the following video by Doug LLoyd to get introduced to C's basic data types (including a preview of more advanced types).

Then, answer the following questions:

-   What is the "precision problem" concerning floats that Doug talked about?

    <textarea name="form[precision_problem]" rows="4" required></textarea>

-   Why would a variable of the `bool` data type only take 1 bit of storage in a computer's memory?

    <textarea name="form[bool_size]" rows="4" required></textarea>

-   Describe the difference between *initializing* a variable and *assigning a value* to a variable.

    <textarea name="form[precision_problem]" rows="4" required></textarea>


## Operators

C also has a lot of operators that allow you to combine values into calculations. Watch Doug's video before continuing.

And another question:

-   Discuss the difference between the equality operator and the assignment operator, including what symbols are to be used for each in C.

    <textarea name="form[equal_assign]" rows="4" required></textarea>


## Practice Book

Take your Programming Basics book and do **all exercises** from chapters 1, 2 and 3. It's important to do the exercises by hand (on paper), without using a calculator. When done like that, you'll develop a little bit of intuition about the basic calculations that are part of many computer programs. You will need it for the next module.

If you already have some experience with calculations in programming languages, be sure to do the last few exercises of every page and check if what you think is the answer is indeed correct! All answers are in the back of the book.

After completing your practice exercises you will take an online test. We intend you to make it without errors. When you fail the online test (it has 13 questions), you can simply take it again. If you have any questions, just drop the question in the forums and discuss!

> One particular point of the tests is that you can infer the **data type** of the outcome of an expression. Especially take care of writing `5.0` (with a decimal point) when the answer is a floating-point number, and writing `5` if the answer is an integer.

Remember to take a screenshot when you finish your test and submit it, below!

## Submitting

When done with the test, take a screenshot of the results screen. You can attach it below; it will be uploaded together with your answers to the questions.
