# Revise your own code

You have now received feedback from your partner and discussed the fine points. You have made a list of things you'd like to change.

1.  Now make those changes in your code. Summarize in the next box the things that you change in response to the feedback that you got from your partner:

    <textarea name="form[changes_review]" rows="8" required></textarea>

2.  Also make note of any things that you change not as much in response to the feedback, but any additional changes that you think of:

    <textarea name="form[changes_adhoc]" rows="8" required></textarea>

3.  Use `style50` to do final checks for basic mistakes. Note which changes do you make in response to this tool's feedback:

    <textarea name="form[changes_style50]" rows="8" required></textarea>

4.  What kind of changes did you make and What did you **not** change in response to the reviews, and why?

    <textarea name="form[not_changed]" rows="3" required></textarea>

Now save your changed file, make sure that it compiles and runs correctly, review your answers above, and then submit.
