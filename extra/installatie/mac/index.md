# macOS: Installing

To develop with C you need some tools on you laptop. This guide helps you with installing al these tools.


## Step 1: Install Command Line Tools

Open the Terminal app (press `⌘-Space`, type terminal and press enter).

Run

    xcode-select --install

and click "Install".

If you find an error message, try installing it manually.
Goto <https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Command%20Line%20Tools%20for%20Xcode>.
Download and install the latest non-beta version from this page.


## Step 2: Brew

Some useful development tools can be installed on Mac using [_Homebrew_](https://brew.sh/).

1. Open the terminal app (press `⌘-Space`, type **terminal** and press enter).

2. Run

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

to install Homebrew.

3. Homebrew will ask for your password, no character will appear on screen, this is normal.

4. Press __return__ (enter) to start the installation.

5. _(Only for Apple Silicon (M1) Macs!!!)_ Read the "Next steps" and execute the lines in the terminal, it probably looks like:

        echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> .zprofile
        eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

    But please execute the lines you see in your terminal, they can be slightly different!

6. Please confirm `brew` is installed correctly by executing `brew --version`. You will see a version number as output.


## Step 3: Python

Open the Terminal app and run

    brew install python

to install python (you won't be using it soon). Then run

    pip3 install check50

And run:

    brew install minprog/pkg/libcs50

> Please note that _only_ the commands `python3` and `pip3` will open the right version of Python.
> Always run your program with `python3` and install packages with `pip3` otherwise you will use an old version!

## Step 4: Atom


Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/) with:

    brew install atom
