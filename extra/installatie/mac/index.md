# macOS: Installing

To develop with a C compiler you will need some tools on your Mac. This guide helps you to install these tools and a code editor.

## Step 1: Tools

Open the "Terminal" application on your Mac, and enter the following line:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uvapl/installer/main/run.sh)"

This is a script that will guide you through most of the installation. Whenever you get error messages that you don't understand, please contact the course's staff for help.

## Step 2: Atom

Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/).
